# Rewrite
Rewrite exists to facilitate code generation for different languages by using common structures and concepts to define intent.


## Purpose

Rewrite is not a complex code generation system, it's purpose is simply to minimize effort in generating small-medium repetitive codesets. It isn't meant for or be used as a language replacement (that would be a waste of time) but as a means to organize and define a finite set of concepts that make generating code (primarily for Go) easier and type-safe.


## Application

- Auto-generated HTTP Handlers
- Auto-generated Tracing Decorators
- Auto-generated GraphQL handlers


### Caution to Self.

Limit scope of this project, this is not some super code gen, it's relatively simple and meant for simple use. Becare of scope overload/creep.
